The G-Trendalyzer2.0 is a Streamlit App that connects to the PyTrends library to get the Top & Rising Related Keyword trends from Google Trends by Orit Mutznik. Google Trends - Rising & Top

To use the tool, you input your 5 keywords of choice (API Limit), pick the geo (start typing to find it faster) & timeframe and... Presto! All the related kws trends.
This app has been built in python using Streamlit, and it's public here.
It's an evolution of my original Google Trends Analyser Colab Open In Colab , which is still very useful if you want always run the same kws every time.
