. Google Trends - Rising & Top + all related terms.

To use the tool, you input your 5 keywords of choice (API Limit, meaning you might run into 429 too many requests response), pick the geo (start typing to find it faster) & timeframe and... Presto! All the related kws trends - breakouts included so this can get you up to 25 related keywords per input kw (if that info is available) and you can download all terms to CSV, XSLX or copy all.

This app has been built in python using Streamlit, originally by me, broken and then fixed with AI. and it's public here.

It's an evolution of my original <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Google Trends Analyser Colab
</a>, which is still very useful if you want always run the same kws every time.
